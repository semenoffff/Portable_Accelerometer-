# Portable_Accelerometer-
LSM6DS3 --> via I2C to Arduino UNO --> via USB to PC

Code in this reposatory is for reading data from accelerometer and gyroscope of LSM6DS3 MEMS sensor from ST.
Arduino UNO used here only because of convenience and its simplicity.
Even though repo name "Portable_Accelerometer" at the current stage it is hard wired. I2C between MEMS sensor and Arduino
and USB cable between Arduino and PC.
In the feature I would like to swap Arduino board for MCU with WI-FI/Bluetoorh module.
